# Changelog

## 2026-03-08 **Added language-agnostic testing skill**
- Created base `testing` skill with universal principles: strict assertions, mock discipline (terminology: mock vs fake vs stub), naming conventions, record/replay preference
- Updated `csharp-testing` and `python-testing` to reference `@taskmill:testing` instead of repeating general principles
- Added `@taskmill:testing` to workflow skill invocation table

## 2026-03-08 **Revised log command to use git commits only**
- Removed changelog.md dependency: no longer reads changelog for cutoff detection or tone matching
- Made cutoff argument required (e.g. `today`, `yesterday`, `2h ago`)
- Changed output to plain narrative prose with no headings, no bullet points, no markdown
- Added language prefix support (e.g. `nor`, `en`, `fr`) and free-text guidance for emphasis/length

## 2026-03-08 **Revised plan step format for better granularity and mandatory tests**
- Added step-writing rules to `finalize` command: one step per file, explicit file paths and function/class names, no compound steps
- Added mandatory test steps: plans must include test steps when `## Files` contains source code files
- Replaced minimal plan example in `skill-formats.md` with a detailed example showing per-file steps and test steps
- Updated `finalize.md`, `finalize-do.md`, and `finalize-do-commit.md` build outputs with the new guidance

## 2026-03-08 **Added Python skills and language-agnostic build routing**
- Created `python-build` skill: `ruff check .` + `pytest` as mandatory build commands
- Created `python-comments` skill: module docstrings required, concise function docstrings, no Args/Returns sections, imperative inline comments
- Created `python-testing` skill: pytest conventions with fixtures, parametrize, strict assertions
- Made workflow skill language-agnostic: added Language Detection section with marker-file table (`pyproject.toml` → Python, `.csproj` → C#)
- Updated `do` command to route to the detected language's build skill instead of hardcoding `@taskmill:csharp-build`
- Updated BUILD.md result tree with new `python-*` skill entries

## 2026-03-07 **Added finalize-do, finalize-do-commit, finalize-do-all commands**
- Three new commands combine finalization with immediate implementation, eliminating the manual two-step process
- `finalize-do`: finalize + implement, no commit
- `finalize-do-commit`: finalize + implement + commit (refuses on main without `--onmain`)
- `finalize-do-all`: finalize + implement all planned tasks committing after each
- Changed `model: sonnet` to `model: opus` in do, do-commit, do-all commands

## 2026-03-07 **Added add-discuss command**
- New command adds a task to the backlog via `task_add.py`, claims it via `task_claim.py`, then proceeds with the standard discuss flow

## 2026-03-07 **Simplified backlog task handling**
- Added `task_plan.py` script: marks a task `[p]` and adds/replaces `plan:` sub-bullet using filelock; used by `finalize` command instead of direct Edit on backlog.md
- Added `validate-backlog.sh` PreToolUse hook: reads tool input JSON from stdin, blocks Edit/Write calls targeting `backlog.md`
- Added `hooks/hooks.json` with PreToolUse entries for Edit and Write matchers
- Updated `finalize` command to use `task_plan.py` instead of direct backlog edits
- Added explicit "never Edit/Write backlog.md" rule to `formats` and `workflow` skills
- Extended `BUILD.md` to describe hooks/ output directory

## 2026-03-07 **Revised git and workflow skills**
- Replaced blanket "never operate on main" rule with nuanced branch policy: never switch TO main, can create new branches, committing on main requires `--onmain` override
- Added `do-commit` command: checks branch, prompts to create new branch if on main, then implements next planned task and commits
- Simplified `do-all` to loop `do-commit` with upfront branch check
- Updated `commit` command with `--onmain` flag support and refusal behavior
- Regenerated affected build outputs: `git/SKILL.md`, `commit.md`, `do-commit.md`, `do-all.md`

## 2026-03-06 **Shortened plugin command names**
- Dropped `task-`/`mill-` prefixes from all plugin commands — now invoked as `/taskmill.discuss`, `/taskmill.finalize`, `/taskmill.do`, `/taskmill.do-all`, `/taskmill.list`, `/taskmill.add`, `/taskmill.retry`, `/taskmill.commit`, `/taskmill.log`
- `task-plan` renamed to `finalize` (more descriptive of what it does)
- `mill-commit` and `mill-logentry` renamed to `commit` and `log`
- Updated `skill-commands.md` section headings, cross-references, and workflow diagram
- Updated `skill-formats.md` command name references and plan step rules example
- Updated `BUILD.md` section pattern description and result listing
- Regenerated all 9 command files in `build/taskmill/commands/` with new names

## 2026-03-05 **New command: mill-logentry**
- Added `mill-logentry` command that generates a changelog entry from recent git commits and prints to stdout
- Accepts optional cutoff time, language, and length/emphasis arguments
- Auto-detects cutoff from newest changelog heading if not specified
- Added spec section to `doc/taskflow/skill-commands.md`, built and deployed to `~/.claude/commands/`

## 2026-03-05 **Fixed build reference in plan steps**
- Changed plan step example from nonexistent `python scripts/build_skills.py` to `Regenerate build output following BUILD.md`
- Updated doc/taskflow/skill-formats.md, doc/taskflow/skill-commands.md, and corresponding build outputs

## 2026-03-05 **Staleness check uses discussion start time**
- Added `[N]` state (digit 1-9) for tasks claimed by a discussion thread
- Added `started:` sub-bullet to backlog tasks, written when discussion begins via `hanf-discuss-task`
- Added `started:` and `finished:` YAML frontmatter to plan files
- Staleness check now uses `started:` from plan frontmatter instead of filename timestamp, catching changes during discussion phase
- Created `hanf_task_claim.py` script for atomically claiming tasks with thread numbers
- Added `model: sonnet` frontmatter to `hanf-do-planned-task` and `hanf-do-all-planned` commands
- Updated `hanf-list-tasks` to show `[N]` (in discussion) state group
- Updated checkbox regex in `hanf_task_complete.py` and `hanf_task_block.py` to handle digit states

## 2026-03-05 **Multi-threaded planning support**
- Changed plan timestamps from `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM` to `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS` for second-level precision
- Added `## Files` section to plan format for listing files the plan expects to modify
- Added staleness check to `hanf-do-planned-task` and `hanf-do-all-planned`: checks `git log` against plan timestamp and file list before implementing
- Added file locking (`.llm/backlog.lock`) to all task scripts to prevent concurrent `backlog.md` corruption
- Created `hanf_lock.py` shared locking module
- Renamed existing plan files to use HHMMSS format
- Updated all doc specs, rebuilt all skills, commands, and scripts

## 2026-03-05 **Incremental skill build**
- `hanf-skill-build` now defaults to incremental mode using `git diff --name-only HEAD -- doc/` to detect changed sources
- Added `full` argument for complete clean + rebuild
- Added "discussion only" rule to `hanf-discuss-task` to prevent auto-entering plan mode
- Updated BUILD.md to document incremental behavior

## 2026-03-05 **Plan steps must not use slash command syntax**
- Added "Plan step rules" to plan format spec in skill-formats.md
- Added guidance to hanf-finalize-plan in skill-commands.md
- Steps must describe concrete actions, not reference `/hanf-*` commands or `~/.claude/skills/` files

- Renamed 8 existing plan files with incrementing time components
- Rebuilt all skills, commands, and scripts

## 2026-03-04 **Cleaned up backlog: delete completed tasks instead of marking [x]**
- Added `--delete` flag to `hanf_task_complete.py` — deletes matched entry (line + sub-bullets + trailing blank) instead of marking `[x]`
- Updated `hanf-do-planned-task`, `hanf-do-all-planned`, `hanf-retry-blocked` to use `--delete` for backlog operations
- Removed "done" count from `hanf-list-tasks` status summary
- Removed `[x]` state from backlog example and state table in `skill-formats.md`; noted that `[x]` is only for plan files
- Updated `skill-workflow.md` task completion step to say "task entry deleted"
- Removed pre-existing `[x]` entry from backlog

## 2026-03-04 **Fixed checkbox matching in task scripts**
- Replaced substring matching (`marker in line`) with line-start-anchored regex (`r'^\s*- \[(.)\] '`)
- Uses `re.sub` for state replacement instead of `str.replace()` to avoid modifying bracket patterns in title text
- Added "Checkbox matching" section to `doc/taskflow/skill-scripts.md` as the behavioral spec
- Affected scripts: hanf_task_get.py, hanf_task_complete.py, hanf_task_block.py
