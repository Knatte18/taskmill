# Build

Instructions for Claude Code. Read this file, then generate the taskmill plugin into `build/taskmill/`.

---

## 1. Read all spec files

Scan `doc/` for:
- All `skill-*.md` files (in any subfolder)
- `doc/taskflow/skill-commands.md` (command specs)
- `doc/taskflow/skill-scripts.md` (script specs)

---

## 2. Generate files into `build/taskmill/`

### Plugin manifest → `build/taskmill/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`

Generate the plugin manifest:

```json
{
  "name": "taskmill",
  "description": "Task management, workflow orchestration, and coding skills for Claude Code",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "license": "Apache-2.0",
  "author": {
    "name": "Knatte18"
  }
}
```

### All skills → `build/taskmill/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

Every `skill-*.md` becomes a SKILL.md file in its own directory:

- `skill-<name>.md` → `build/taskmill/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Language subfolders get a prefix: `doc/coding/csharp/skill-comments.md` → `build/taskmill/skills/csharp-comments/SKILL.md`
- **Exception:** `skill-commands.md` and `skill-scripts.md` are not skills — they are sources for commands and scripts.

**Skill files in `doc/` are plugin-ready.** They already contain YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and use `@taskmill:<name>` cross-references. The build step copies each skill file verbatim into its output path — no transformation is applied.

### Commands → `build/taskmill/commands/`

Each `## <name>` section in `doc/taskflow/skill-commands.md` → `build/taskmill/commands/<name>.md`

**Exception:** `mill-build` and `mill-deploy` are repo-local dev commands. They are NOT included in the plugin output — they live only in `.claude/commands/` inside the taskmill repo.

```yaml
---
description: "<what the command does>"
argument-hint: "<if applicable>"
---

<complete behavioral spec for this command>
```

- When a command needs skill rules, reference them as: `Use @taskmill:<name> skill`
- Reference scripts as: `python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/<script-name>`

### Scripts → `build/taskmill/scripts/`

Each `## task_*` section in `doc/taskflow/skill-scripts.md` → `build/taskmill/scripts/<script-name>.py`

Implement according to the behavioral spec: parameters, selection priority, output, exit codes.

### Hooks → `build/taskmill/hooks/`

Copy `doc/taskflow/hooks.json` → `build/taskmill/hooks/hooks.json` verbatim.
Copy `doc/taskflow/validate-backlog.sh` → `build/taskmill/hooks/validate-backlog.sh` verbatim.

---

## 3. Marketplace manifest

The file `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at the repo root is maintained manually (not generated). It points to `./build/taskmill` as the plugin source.

---

## Updating skills

Edit spec files in `doc/`, then run `mill-build` to regenerate into `build/taskmill/`. Then run `mill-deploy` to reinstall the plugin.

By default, the build is **incremental**: it uses `git diff --name-only HEAD -- doc/` to detect changed sources and only regenerates their corresponding outputs. Use `mill-build full` for a complete clean + rebuild.
